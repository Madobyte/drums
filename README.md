01/27/2021 - Initial Commit

I pushed my first commit. The tink.wav [KeyK] was not working inside Mozilla Firefox (inside my Ubuntu virtualbox). 
The console was throwing a warning that says:

Cannot play media. No decoders for requested formats: audio/x-wav, audio/x-wav, audio/x-wav, audio/x-wav

I had to try it out on Google Chrome on Windows. It turns out that it is working perfectly fine.
I need to work on the user interface next.
